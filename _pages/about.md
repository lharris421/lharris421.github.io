I am a 5th year PhD candidate at the University of Iowa in the Department of Biostatistics advised by <a href='https://myweb.uiowa.edu/pbreheny/'>Patrick Breheny</a>.

My dissertation research focuses on confidence intervals construction for penalized regression models like lasso. Specifically, I see my research as an ode to the lasso. How? I am particularly interested in intervals that respect the original model fit. Many methods focus on debiasing, but this inherently requires ignoring the lasso penalty in one way or another. This requires a shift in perspective, and if you are interested in hearing more, a paper is in submission and I will make it available here as soon as I can. Or, if you have thoughts or questions, don't hesitate to email me!

In my spare time you can find me outside. I'm either at the park with my two dog-hters, backpacking with my wife (and dog-hters), or running somewhere lost on a trail.
